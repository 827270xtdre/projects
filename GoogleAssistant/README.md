# Google Assistant using 96Boards
The Google Assistant project aims at deploying Google Assistant on a DragonBoard 410c by 96Boards. Recently, Google released a software development kit (SDK) which allows third party developers to build their own Google Assistant on hardware of their choice. The SDK lets us add features such as hotword detection, voice control and natural language processing to devices of our choice. In this project we will make our own version of Google Assistant using a DragonBoard 410c, a USB mic and speakers.
